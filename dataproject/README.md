# Dataproject

The dataproject is an insight into the extent of tourism in Denmark. Statistics Denmark has records of have many foreigners, who spend the night in one of Denmarks many hotels, campingsites etc. The observations are monthly data from 2014-2018, broken down by the nationality of the tourists and which region in Denmark they stay. First the evolution of the level of tourism is examined and then the seasonal effects are extracted. Finally the charactaristics of the visiting tourists is closly studied. The interesting questions are who is visiting Denmark, and where do they live?

For the analysis and datahandling, a bunch of different packages and a shape-file for the administrational borders in Denmark is used. Everything is documented in the Jupyter Notebook. The shapefile (.shp) is also uploaded in the repository in the folder "Geofiles".

Happy reading!
